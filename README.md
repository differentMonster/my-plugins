## What to do now
## Now, you have few more things you can do in your future life:

## Use your NPM package to revolutionize the world, or at least the developer world. You can also read about how it can revolutionize you, as well.
## Shrink your monolith of a project into something smaller and easier to work with by moving some of your code into NPM packages. Within reasonable bounds, of course. Too many NPM packages could be a nightmare to maintain too.
## Contribute to other NPM packages. I can really recommend this! #hacktoberfest
## Copy your NPM package onto a USB stick and give it as a gift to your family and friends. I am sure they would appreciate it!
